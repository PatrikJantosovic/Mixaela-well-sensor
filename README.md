# Mixaela-well-sensor

IoT Project to create a distance sensor using:
  - Raspberry Pi Zero
  - Ultrasonic sensor HY-SRF05
  - Python


## Goal
The goal is to create a functional prototype of a distance sensor, that measures the distance in regular intervals and send the measurement in json format to web api.


## Prerequisities
- Raspberry Pi Zero
- HY-SRF05 sensor
- Python 3 (3.8 is used)
- RPI.GPio module
